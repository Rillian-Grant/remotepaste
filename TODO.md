# TODO

## Redis

- Store user data in hashmap or different keys

## Security

- GUID uniqueness <https://stackoverflow.com/a/904967/10251041>
- Key phrase <https://www.npmjs.com/package/bip39>
- Check encryption key before sending encrypted data. Needed due to small key size.

## Later

- Multi core support with clusters <https://rowanmanning.com/posts/node-cluster-and-express/> <https://betterprogramming.pub/scaling-node-js-applications-with-multiprocessing-b0c25511832a>
- Fallback to WebRTC if file is bigger than server limit <https://peerjs.com/>
